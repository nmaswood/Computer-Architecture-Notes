# Review
* Difference between task level  and other level parallelism
* Multicore is easy to commmunicate
*
# Parallel Programming is Challenging
* Correctness
* Perf improvement
    * make programmer's life easier to do this
    * design techniques that can overcome bottlenecks
* Main Multicore Design Issues
    * cache coherence
        * ensure correct oeration in the presence of private caches
* Shared Memory Model
    * Many programs communciate through shared memory
    * Proc 0 writes to an address, followed by Proc 1 reading
        * implies communication between 2 cores
    *  What is Mem[a] is cached at either end
    * question of cache coherence
* Whose Responsibility?
    * Programmer
        * Keep caches coherent in software responsibility
        * make microarchitectres life easier
# What if All Caches Are Shared
* All caches are shared between processors
* Shared resources
    * you would never see this situation
    * correctnss is not a problem, still need to handle race conditions
    *
# What if all caches are shared?
* All caches are shared
    * No need for coherence
* more  but didnt write
# Maintain Coherence
* All see a consistent value
* Writes to A by p0 should be seen by p1, and all writes to A should appear in some order
* Coherence needs to provide
    * write propogation: guarantee updates will propogate
    * write serialization: provide a consistent global order seen by all processors
# Snooping Caches
* Cache snoops (observe) each otehr's write/ read operations. If a processor wites toa  block, all others invalidate the block
