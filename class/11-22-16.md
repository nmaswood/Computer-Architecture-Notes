# Main Memory 
    * Need for main-memory capacity & bandwith increasing
        * Multicore: morecores -> larger working set
        * data intesnsive
        * apps share memory
    * 50 % energy spent in off chip access
    * DRAM technology scaling is ending
        * higher capacity, density, lower cost energy
* Memory Capacity Gap
    * memory capacity per core expected to drop by 30% every two years
    * Trends worse for memory bandwidth per core
