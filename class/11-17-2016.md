#  Multicore
* Atomic Read and Write
    * Aka. read-modify-write
    * specify memory location
        *  value in location read into a register
        * another value is stored into location
        * many variants based don what values are allowed in II
    * Simple Example: test&set
    * Read memory location itno speified register
    * Store constant 1 into location
    * Successful if value loaded into register is 0
    * Operation needs to be atomic
* Other primitives
    * Other read-modify-write parameters
        * Swap
        * Compare and swap
    * More fancy implementations
    * Consult ISA specfications
# Virtual Memory
* Physical Memory Problems
    * CPU directly addreses memory
    * Difficult to support code/ data relocation.
        * Processors come and go; fragmentation issues, external fragmentation
    * Protection/ Isolation difficult
    * Code/ Data share?
    * Isa can be bigger than physical memory
* Alternatives to directive memory
    * Base and bound (BB)
    * Segmentation
* Benefits of VM
    * programmer does not nee dto know size of memory, small can appear big
* Mechanism
    * Virtual address, map virtual 
    * ATM 
        * address translation emechanism
    * OS managed page table
    *
    *
* Virtual Pages, Physical Frames 
    * Virtuual addres space divinde in pages
    * Physical address space divided into frames
    * If an accessed page is not in memory, but on disk
        * Generates a page fault
        * Virtual memory system brings page into physical frame
    * Page Table: mapping of virtual pages
* Page Table is per process
    * allocated on per process basis
    * benefits on how to manage memory
* Page Size
    * What is the granularity of mangamnt of physical memory?
    * Specified by ISA
        * 4KB, 8KB, 4MB, 2BG
    * smaller page size better for internal fragmentation
    * Large vs. Small Trades offs
* Vritual to Physical Address Space
    * Parameters
        * P page size
        * N virtual address limit
        * physical address limit
        * M is usually bigger than N
    * virtual address
    * physical address
    *
* Address Translation Using Page Table
    * What is in PTE
        * A valid bit
        * PFN for corresponding VPN -> support translation
        * Control bits to support replacement
        * Dirty bit indicates writeback
        * Protection bits to enable access control & protection
